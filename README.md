# Tetris Project

This project was created as a recreational and educational exercise to learn about Asyncronous Threads and Machine Learning in games.

- Folder `TetrisGame` -> Contains a single file that when run allows you to play tetris in python using asd to move left right and down, r to rotate and x to instantly move a piece to the end.
- Folder `HeuristicTetrisBot` -> Contains three files, run `tetrisBotHeuristic.py` to see a heuristic model that follows a set of rules playing tetris.
- Folder `qLearning` -> Contains two files, run `qLearningBot` to see q model playing tetris.
- Folder `TetrisPredictionBot` -> Contains 4 files, run `tetrisBot.py` to see a model who sees a few moves in the future to determine the best move.
